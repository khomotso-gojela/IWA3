1. Why does the code not work?
    ~ the javascript file was not properly linked with the html file
    ~ the variable used in the scripts.js file were not imported correctly(wrong syntax)
    ~ the imported variables were not exported in the config.js file.
    
2. What changes do you need to make to achieve the intended behaviour?
    ~ link scripts file with correct syntax.
    ~ export variables in the configuration.js file
    ~ import variables from the config file with corrrect syntaz.
    
3. Are there any other ways in which it can be been solved?
    ~ we can import the whole configuuration.js file to scripts.js file instead of importing each variable individually.
